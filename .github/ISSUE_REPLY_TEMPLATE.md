Hello!

After April 2016, Miraheze moved from GitHub to [Phabricator](https://meta.miraheze.org) for issue tracking. We no longer fix issues reported on GitHub.

Please use Phabricator for reporting issues. It won't take long to make an account there, since we offer OAuth integration to our Miraheze wikis and GitHub. Phabricator's markup is almost identical to GitHub's one, so you'll get used to it very fast.

Thank you!
